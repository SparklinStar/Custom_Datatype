# MathOps Toolkit: Custom Python Data Types & GUI Calculator ; Open for contributions in hacktoberfest

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest edition of our repository! We're excited to have you on board as a contributor. Our goal is to expand this repository by adding custom Python data types for mathematical operations and building a GUI calculator using these data types by the end of October.

## Custom Python Data Types for Mathematical Operations

This repository contains custom Python data types for various mathematical operations. These data types are designed to help you work with mathematical concepts and operations in a structured and efficient manner. Below, you'll find a list of the available custom data types along with a brief description of each:

## Available Custom Data Types

### 1. Matrix
- A custom data type to represent matrices with operations like matrix addition, multiplication, determinant calculation, and transpose.

### 2. Fraction
- A custom data type for fractions with attributes for the numerator and denominator. It implements methods for arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 3. Complex Number
- A custom data type to represent complex numbers with attributes for the real and imaginary parts. It includes methods for arithmetic operations specific to complex numbers, such as complex multiplication and division.

### 4. Polynomial
- A custom data type to represent polynomials with attributes for coefficients. It implements methods for polynomial addition, subtraction, multiplication, and evaluation.

### 5. Vector
- A custom data type to represent vectors in n-dimensional space. It includes operations like vector addition, subtraction, dot product, and cross product.

### 6. Set
- A custom data type for sets with methods for set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and checking for subsets.

### 7. Graph
- A custom data type to represent graphs with nodes and edges. It implements methods for graph traversal, shortest path algorithms, and connectivity checks.

### 8. Statistical Distribution
- Custom data types for various statistical distributions, such as normal distribution or exponential distribution. It includes methods for probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions, and random sampling.

### 9. Geometry Shape
- A custom data type for representing geometric shapes (e.g., circles, triangles, rectangles) with attributes specific to each shape (e.g., radius, side lengths). It implements methods for calculating area, perimeter, and other shape-specific calculations.

### 10. Quaternion
- A custom data type to represent quaternions, which are used in 3D rotations. It includes methods for quaternion multiplication, conjugation, and rotation operations.

## Hacktoberfest Contributions

For Hacktoberfest, we encourage you to contribute in the following ways:

1. **Implement Missing Data Types:** Help us complete the list of custom data types mentioned above. Choose a data type, create a Python class for it, and implement the relevant mathematical operations.

2. **GUI Calculator:** As an additional challenge, we invite you to create a GUI calculator using these custom data types. You can use libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or any other GUI framework you prefer. The calculator should support basic mathematical operations and utilize our custom data types.

To contribute, please fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. We'll review your contributions and merge them into the project.
